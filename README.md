# base-fps-game
A Base fps Game, made with UE4, Extendable to UE5.

### The Reason Why this was made:
- you see, there are not many open source True Game Base abvailable in the Gitverse (idk what that is)
- more commits = more features
  
### USAGE:
- clone or download
- open with UE4.27 (Chaos) or UE5 (any version)
- If Epic launcher doesnt show it, check the Epic games config ini files and add the parent directory of uour project as project location.
